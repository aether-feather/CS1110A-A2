CS1110A-A2 Programming in Python Course by Baker College

Projects posted here are not required / graded assignments to prevent plagiarism. "Note" comments in programs are for classmates new to coding in Python specifically. I will update this repository with small side projects as I move through the course.

All programs are created in Visual Studio Code
